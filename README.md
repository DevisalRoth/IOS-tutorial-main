# Class 

Reference Type:
A class is a reference type in Swift. When you create an instance of a class and assign it to a variable or pass it as an argument to a function, you are working with a reference to the instance. Multiple references can point to the same instance in memory.

Mutable State:
Since classes are reference types, changes made to the instance through one reference are visible through all references to that instance. If you modify the properties of a class instance through one reference, other references pointing to the same instance will reflect those changes.

Blueprint for Objects:
A class serves as a blueprint or template for creating objects (instances). You define the properties and methods in a class, and then you can create multiple instances of that class.
