# class VS struct

Type: A structure is a value type while a class is a reference type.

Inheritance: A structure cannot inherit from other types while a class can.

Deinitializers: Structures cannot have custom deinitializers while a class can.

Multiple references: We can have more than one reference to a class instance; however, with structures, we cannot.
